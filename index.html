    <h2>Best Battle History Band out there!</h2>

They sing the stories, of the real life wars and the people who played their parts in those stories. Gruelling campaigns and awestruck acts of bravery. The magnificent victories and heart pulling personal struggles. The songs tell the true stories, more fantastic than any form of fiction.</p>

    <p>They are best known for their <strong>electrifying</strong> live concerts, combining accomplished musical performances and a finely-crafted stage show, inculding their full-sized tank drum-riser, with energy and laughter. The band headlined as far as North America, Australia, and Japan. They <em>regularly</em> fill arenas and take top-billed slots at festivals across Europe.</p>

    <p>In the nearly <em>two decades</em> since their launch, Sabaton has caved out a reputation as one of the hardest working bands in the business. And thus gained the legion of a very loyal fan base around the globe. This has brought them eight <strong>highly-rated</strong> studio albums, (as well as two certified platinum-sellers). Also scoring multiple industry awards, wins, and nominations. Not to mention, they launched their own annual festival and cruise.</p>
